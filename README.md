# hello-world
My first repository

I am interested in learning about opensource and openstack technologies.  
Former programmer/DBA now solution architect in technology sales.
Trying to understand how enterprise technology can enable devops.
Additionally I'd like to build simple applications for practical use at home with opensource code.
